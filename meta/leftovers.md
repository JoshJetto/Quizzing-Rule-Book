## Mission Statement
Mission Statement of Bible Quizzing
"The mission of quizzing is to see visible evidence of the application of God's Word in the lifestyle of each participant."

Bible Quizzing is a ministry of the LIFE Office of the C&MA to assist teens to connect with God in a deeper way by Experiencing Him and Expanding His Kingdom.

It accomplishes this by:
- Providing teens with an opportunity to be involved with systematic study, application and memorization of God's Word.
- Building character, instilling self-discipline and encouraging prayer and unity.
- Equipping teens with the capacity to serve in other areas of ministry.

## International Head Coach
The international coach must be approved by his/her district office/committee or by the District Bible Quizzing Coordinator.

## District Coordinator
The district quizmaster and officials will be approved by the District Bible Quizzing Coordinator or Committee. 

## Competitive Levels
Competitive Levels
There are four levels of Bible quiz competition: local or interchurch, zone, district, and International Finals.  Each district shall determine eligibility guidelines for all local, zone, and district competitions subject to approval by the district office.

### Local or Interchurch Quizzing
(Within a church or between several churches on an unofficial basis) Any number from one to five may constitute a team.
Any number of teams may participate.
The person/people responsible for preparation of the quizzes used for competition will be assigned by the person in charge of sponsoring the competition.
If a church is unable to secure enough teens for study and competition within its own group, it may work with a neighboring church for competition on this level.
Follow all other rules as clearly as possible in order to educate for zone and higher levels of competition.

### Zone Quizzing
The quizmaster and officials will be selected by the Zone/District Executive Committee/District Coordinator, or Designee.
The person/people responsible for preparation of the quizzes used for competition will be assigned by the District Coordinator or Zone Coordinator.
Follow rules as determined by district for zone quiz meets. 

### District Quizzing
Rules may be modified by each district to suit the needs of their district.  Any changes in the rules need to be approved by the District Coordinator or District Committee.  The district office may grant exemptions for unusual circumstances in regard to district quizzing only.
The quizmaster and officials will be approved by the District Committee or District Coordinator.
The name and address of the district coordinator must be sent to the Life Impact Office by October 1st of that quiz year. 
For district finals, each quiz must cover the year's material in its entirety.

The director of Life Impact Ministries shall serve ex officio as a resource to the leadership team to coordinate programming and appropriate support for the International Quizzing Competition.
