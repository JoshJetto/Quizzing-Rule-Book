# Initial-Version Scope

The goal and scope of this initial version is to produce a usable rule book for *International Bible Quizzing* (IBQ) and district level quizzing that is *functionality equivalent* (FE) to the existing or current rule book. What this means is that if someone were to read the completed product of this project's initial version, they should render a quiz and meet that is indistinguishable from quizzes and meets at the IBQ level.

Given the buggy and inconsistent of the current rule book, this is actually impossible because there are instances where the rule book itself contradicts itself and other instances where IBQ does not follow the rule book. Here's how we'll resolve these situations:

- Where the rule book contradicts itself, we will write language in the new rule book such that the resulting quizzes and meets will match IBQ
- Where IBQ does not follow the rule book, we will use the intended defintions from the current rule book

## Rule Book Versus Best Practices

Content that should go in the rule book are items that can be challenged and anything required to be understood to conduct a quiz or meet. Other content should go in the best practice document.

Content that ends up in the best practices document cannot be challenged, but it can be "objected" to. This process of objecting is out of scope for the initial version of this project. However, it should be included in the next iteration.
