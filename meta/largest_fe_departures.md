# Largest Departures from Functional Equivalence

To rewrite the current rule book:

- Using consistent language
- Resolving any "current rule book bugs"
- Rewriting language to match how the majority of quiz districts and competitions apply the rule book

It was necessary to make changes that were not Functionally Equivalent. The largest of these changes are listed here, to aid those reviewing the rewritten rule book.

## Changes

- All items moved to the Best-Practices document.
- All items moved under Examples headers. Previously, examples could be scrutinized for what they implied about how the wording used should be interpreted and applied. Moving them to a separate section makes it clear that they are examples only, and no ruling interpretations should be inferred from the specific examples.
- 2-3 word Unique Phrases, language allowing for multiple occurrences of these phrases, as long as they occur in the same verse. This change matches the definition on unique words.
- Chapter-Verse, language made explicit that words/phrases occurring more than once in the same chapter, but only in the same verse, are not valid bases for chapter-verse reference questions.
- Non-captains can request an explanation of a ruling.
- The 3rd error by the same quizzer is -10 points for that quizzer. The previous wording could be read as "every 2 errors" was -10, which would mean the 3rd error would not be -10.
- Moved "Identify the question type of each question and begin every question with, "question number_____, question"." from Quizmaster Should to Quizmaster Must. This reflects what is generally accepted as a requirement of the Quizmaster.
- Removed "The quizzer may not continue into or change to another verse" with regard to quotes/finish.
