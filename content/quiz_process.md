# Quiz Process

## Types of Quizzes

    Set quiz types to
        "3-Team 20-Question", "2-Team 15-Question Tie-Breaker",
        "2-Team 20-Question", "2-Team Overtime", and "3-Team Overtime".

## Quizzes
There will be no duplicate questions in a single quiz. 

Participating on a Question
: A team that is eligible to jump on the question. A team that has no quizzers eligible to jump because of either foul out, err out, or quiz out, is still considered a team that is eligible to jump.

## Toss-Up Questions
- When 3 teams are participating on a question, and one team errs, the next question will be a toss-up question for the two teams that did not err on the previous question.
    - The team that erred is ineligible to jump on the toss-up question.
    - If only two teams were participating on a question and one team errs, the next question will be a bonus question, not a toss-up question.
    - If only one team was participating on a question, it must have been a bonus question. As such any outcome of the bonus question results in all three teams participating on the next question.

## Bonus Questions
- If only two teams are participating on a question, and one team errs, the next question will be an assigned bonus question for the team that did not err.
    - An assigned bonus question is awarded to the corresponding chair of the chair that erred on the toss-up.

### Example
If chair #2 erred on the toss-up, chair #2 of the team that did not err on the toss-up will be awarded the bonus question.

### 3-Team Quiz
- There will be 20 numbered questions in a quiz.
- In the event the quiz ends in a tie, additional units of three overtime questions each will be used until the tie is broken.  Two-team rules will apply in overtime if only two teams are involved.  During overtime, all the numbered questions will be of a different question type.
- A toss-up question is the result of an error by one team.  The two remaining teams will have the opportunity to jump, but the team making the error is ineligible for that question.
    - If question 1 to 15 is erred, the next numbered question will be a toss-up question. 
    - If question 16-20 is erred, and if three teams were participating on 16, the toss-up question will be question 16A.  
- Bonus Questions
    - If toss-up question 2 to 15 is erred, then the next numbered question is a bonus question.
    - If question 16 is a toss-up question and is erred, 16A is a bonus question.
    - If 16A-20A is a toss-up and is erred, then 16B-20B is a bonus question.
- Error points begin at question 17.

### Tie-Breaker Quiz
- In the event three teams are involved, a 20-question tie-breaker quiz will be used.
    - The above rules for a three-team, 20-question quiz applies.
- In the event two teams are involved, a 15-question tie-breaker quiz will be used with the following guidelines:
    - If an error occurs on questions 1 through 11, the next numbered question is a 20-point bonus question.
    - If questions 12, 13, 14, or 15 are erred, the bonus question will remain on the same question number and will not be counted in the basic 15 questions. Both teams must jump on questions 13, 14, and 15.
    - All bonus questions up to and including 12B are worth 20 points.
    - All bonus questions from 13 to the end of the quiz are worth 10 points.
    - Error points begin at question 13.
    - A quiz-out is 3 correct questions.

### 2-Team 20-Question Quiz
- There will be 20 questions in a quiz.
- All questions have a value of 20 points when two teams are eligible.
- If questions 1-15 are erred, the next question will be a bonus question.
- If questions 16-20 are erred, 16A-20A will be a bonus question.
- All bonus questions throughout the whole quiz are 10 points. 

## Platform Protocol

    Set the readiness bonus to 20.

- Quizzers will be seated facing the audience and quizmaster.
- Feet of the quizzers are to be on the floor while jumping. 
- A line-up card showing the seating order of each quizzer should be given to the quizmaster or scorekeeper before the start of each quiz.
- No verbal or non-verbal communication is permitted between quizzers, coaches, or the audience from the time the quizmaster calls introduces the question type until points have been awarded.
- Only a coach from a team presently seated on the platform, or the meet director may confer with the officials.
- Coaches may have quiz material(s) on the platform during a time-out or prior to a quiz.
- Quizzers will not touch the officials table.
- Push-button quizzing can be provided by a district, if needed by physically disabled quizzers.

## Jumping
- If a quizzer's light comes on after a question has been called and before the question has discernibly begun, a foul will be called.
- If a quizzer's light comes on after the quizmaster has discernibly begun reading the question, this will be considered a valid jump, and the quizzer will be given an opportunity to answer.
- The first quizzer to rise and trigger his/her light, provided there has been no foul, will be recognized.
- If, in the judgment of the officials, a deliberate attempt is made to forfeit a question, an error will be charged, and 10 points deducted from the team score.  The next question will be numbered the same.

### Tie Jumping
- When members of the same team tie, the captain will select one quizzer to answer without any type of verbal or non-verbal communication.
- When quizzers of two or three teams tie, the question will be replaced with a question of the same type on which all eligible members of the tied teams may jump.  The question number remains the same.
- When a quizzer errs on the tie-jump question, it will be treated as a regular question and the quiz will continue as normal.

## Time Limits
- Quizzes will start at the scheduled or announced time.  Any team that is late does not receive the starting 20 points awarded for being on time. 
    - If the late team is currently quizzing in another location which is running over the time limit, they are not required to forfeit the quiz, or lose 20 points.
    - Any team more than 10 minutes late (after the scheduled or announced time for the quiz) forfeits the quiz. 
- If an individual quizzer is late, the quiz will start on time.  The coach has the option to put the late quizzer in during a time-out, but the team will forfeit the 20 points the team starts with. The coach also has the option to keep the quizzer out of the quiz and keep the 20 points but must notify the quizmaster at the beginning of the quiz, of their decision. 
- Quizzers have five seconds in which to jump after the question is completed.
A quizzer has 30 seconds to complete their answer after being recognized.
