# Roles and Responsibilities

## Team Organization

Teams can have up to five quizzers on it. Teams can have up to four quizzers in the quiz at any given time.

### Captains

- Scorekeepers must be notified which quizzer is the captain and which is co-captain before the quizzers take their seats to begin the quiz.
- The captain and co-captain may change during a given competition but not during a quiz.
- Only the captain or co-captain may challenge a decision or respond to a challenge. If both the captain and co-captain have erred out, another quizzer can be designated by the coach to respond to or initiate challenges.

## Quiz Officials

- No comment other than "correct" or "incorrect" need be announced by the quiz officials in making a decision.
    - However, at the discretion of the answer judge and quizmaster, or at the request of the captain, additional information may be given:
        - If the additional information regarding the ruling is provided at the discretion of the AJ/QM, and not at the request of the captain, this is not considered an explanation of a ruling (which would invalidate a Challenge or Protest).
        - If the captain requests additional information regarding the ruling, this is considered an explanation of a ruling and invalidates a Challenge or Protest. Before replying to a request for an explanation, the QM must ask all teams if they wish to Challenge.

### Quizmasters (QM)

The Quizmaster must:

- Maintain a position such that all currently seated quizzers are able to view the quizmaster's face
- Speak in such as a way as to be understood by all quizzers
- Identify the question type of each question and begin every question with, "question number_____, question".
- Rule immediately upon an obviously correct or incorrect answer if there is no indication from the answer judge to the contrary.
    - When an answer is in question (different than the written question), the quizmaster will discuss it with the answer judge.
- During the 30-second answering period use the following prompts:
    - If a quizzer has provided all the information in the answer, except the identification of a pronoun present which is part of the answer text, the quizmaster will ask the quizzer to identify the specific pronoun, (example: "Can you identify 'He'?" or "Can you identify 'They'?") The quizmaster is not allowed to say anything other than what the quizzer has already said when asking for the identification. A pronoun may need to be identified only if the identification (antecedent) is in context.
        - Once the quizzer has completed all information in the answer, the quizmaster will prompt the quizzer to identify the specific pronoun, even if the quizzer has not yet completed all information in the question.
    - On a Chapter-Verse Reference Question or Chapter-Only Reference Question, if the quizzer has given all the information in both the question and the answer and the complete question was not read, the quizmaster will ask, "What is your question?"
    - On a Quote/Finish type question, once the quizzer has quoted to the end of the required verse or verses, if the quote is not yet word-perfect, the quizmaster will say, "Again." This will occur as often as needed until the quizzer quotes the verse perfectly or the 30-second time limit expires.
        - The quizmaster is not allowed to say "again" until the quizzer has come to the end of the verse, each time through, as this would give the quizzer information about where their mistake was made.
    - Once all of the information in both the question and answer has been given, but something needs to be fixed, the quizmaster will say "Again".
    - On a Situation type question, when the quizzer has completed the Quotation the quizmaster will say, "Quote is complete."
    - On an INT or MA Question, if all of the information in the answer text has been given, but the quizzer is missing information in the question text, the quizmaster will say "More".
    - On a Situation question, because the quotation is part of the question, the quizmaster will say "More" when required information from the quotation is missing.
    - On a Q/Q2V, CVR/MACVR, CR/MACR question, if either the chapter or verse number were not completely finished when the quizzer jumped, the quizmaster will say "More".
    - On a Reference type question, if the quizzer gives a reference question that is different than the written question, the quizmaster and answer judge must ensure that the reference question given is the exact same type as the written question.
    - Consult with the answer judge(s) at any time they feel is necessary, provided it does not infringe upon the 30 seconds allotted the quizzer.
    - If an explanation of a ruling is requested by a captain, the quizmaster will ask if any team wants to challenge before the explanation is given.

#### Commentary

On a CVR/MACVR, in the scenario where the entire Reference (which is part of the "Question") was not read by the quizmaster, the quizmaster has two prompts to give, and must give them in appropriate order and with appropriate timing. If the quizzer provides all information in the question "text" and the answer "text", because the quizzer has not yet finished saying the complete Reference (part of the "question"), the quizmaster must prompt with "More." The quizmaster cannot prompt with "What is your question?" yet, because the quizzer has not provided all information in the "question" (which includes the Reference) and the answer.

### Answer Judges (AJ)

- All conferring among quizmaster and answer judge(s) shall be done privately.
    - When an answer given is in question, it is the answer judge who will determine the accuracy of its content and make a ruling accordingly.
- Will watch the quizmaster's reading for accuracy.
- Ensures the quizzer is recognized by the quizmaster when their light comes on.

### Scorekeepers (SK)

- The scorekeeper will tally and immediately announce when a quizzer has erred out, quizzed out, or fouled out.
- The scorekeeper will keep a record of all timeouts.
- To determine eligibility for re-substitution, the scorekeeper will keep a record of the number of questions a substitute quizzer has remained out.
- Either read the score or have the score ready to be read at the beginning of timeouts, when there is no scoreboard.
- The scorekeeper shall have the scoresheets signed by the coaches at the conclusion of each quiz, and report to the statistician.

### Statisticians (ST)

- The statistician will be responsible for keeping individual quizzers' scores.
- The statistician will be responsible for keeping individual teams' scores.
