# Bible Quizzing Rule Book

This is the official rule book for Bible Quizzing, which represents what will be followed at the annual International Bible Quizzing championship meet. It is also a recommendational document for Quizzing districts and any other organizations interested in Bible Quizzing. These districts and other organizations retain the right to set and enforce their own rules using whatever mechanisms they deem most appropriate.

## Logic

There are components within this document that contain logic in the form of *English Script* (ES). ES is a simplified programming language that reads like plain English. For more information, see:
