# Quiz Events

    Set the question answer duration to 30.

## Rulings

## "Question" De-Overloading

The word "question" is significantly overloaded in the current rule book. We're going to try to de-overload it by splitting its usage among the following terms:

**Question**
: Everything (type, ref, question text, answer text, question number, etc.)

**Answer**
: Everything the quizzer says (answer, remaining question, ref, etc.)

**Question Text**
: The full question text of the question

**Answer Text**
: The full answer text of the question

**Read Question**
: Everything the QM says (excluding prompts and rulings)

**Number**
: The identification of which question we are on in a quiz. A question number may be numeric or alphanumeric.

**Numeric**
: A question number with only numbers.

**Alphanumeric**
: A question number with numbers and letters.

### Context

Limited to five verses before or after the verse. On all question types, a quizzer cannot automatically be ruled out of context by a single word, even if it is a unique word. Rather, the quizzer must say a complete thought or phrase that conclusively puts them out of context.

**Interchangeable**
: Means not only not incorrect; means either are correct.

**Special Name**
: A name that imparts specific character qualities or attributes to that person of the deity.

### Deity Rule

- The correct person of the deity must be given.
- The quizzer may not move between persons of the deity when answering. Giving the name of a deity that is not correct is considered giving incorrect information.
- If a quizzer refers to any person of the deity as either "God" or "Lord", these must be clarified by the quizzer within 30 seconds when the text requires a more specific answer.
- "Jesus" and "Christ" are Interchangeable (but refer to the person of the Son) and the quizzer will be called correct.
- If a pronoun is used in the text to name the deity, any of the names for that person of the deity within context may be considered an acceptable answer when clarifying.
    - If the pronoun naming the deity is identified by the quizzer using a name that correctly identifies the deity, but with an identification that is out of context, the quizzer will be considered to have not stayed in context.
- When there is a Special Name of the deity given in the text, the Special Name must be given in the quizzer's answer.
    - If the quizzer states any other Special Names which are not in context, the quizzer will be considered to have not stayed in context, even if they refer to the same person of the deity.
- When a quizzer gives other names for the same person of the deity, used within context, these should be allowed to be clarified within 30 seconds when a more specific answer is needed.

#### Example

- Special Names of a deity, (i.e. "The Lord God Almighty", "The Bread of Life", "Spirit of the Living God".)
- Special Names that aren't in context, Jesus refers to himself as "the bread of life" in John 6 and "the good shepherd" in John 10.

### Correct

The quizzer's response is correct when:

- It fulfills all requirements specific to the Question Type.
- The quizzer stays in Context.
- It contains the information requested.
    - If the quizmaster did not complete the reading of the question, the quizzer's answer must include the information in the remainder of the question as well as the answer.
    - It is not required to be in question and answer form, except in the case of a reference question.
    - The quizzer's answer must include all unique words included in both the question and the answer.

Mispronounced names are still recognizable as the answer.

Only the first response of the quizzer will be considered, however, if the response by the quizzer is in context and is not incorrect, the quizzer will be allowed their full 30 seconds to give the additional information necessary to satisfy the question and the answer.

#### Example

INT Who has been making it grow? A. God. If the quizzer said "Apollos" they have given incorrect information (even though the name "Apollos" is in context) and would be called incorrect. If they had said "I planted the seed", "Apollos watered it", they have not given any incorrect information, are in context, and will be given the 30 seconds to supply the correct answer required.

### Incorrect

The quizzer's response is incorrect when:

- Incorrect information has been given.
- The information given within the time limit is incomplete.
- It does not fulfill all requirements specific to the Question Type.
- Three Incorrect answers (errors) by a quizzer eliminate that quizzer from the quiz. The quizzer must leave the platform immediately.
    - Incorrect answers on bonus questions do not count towards this total. 

#### Example

Incorrect Information, e.g. If the wrong person (i.e. Father, Son, Holy Spirit) in the deity (God) is given.

All requirements are not fulfilled, Any word is omitted or added in a Finish-The-Verse, Finish-This, or Quote Question or the wrong verse is begun.

## Challenges

Challenges exist so quizzers can contest rulings made by quiz officials.

The team captain or co-captain may challenge if:

- There is reason to believe the quiz officials have applied the rule book incorrectly
- There has been a mispronunciation by the quizmaster
- There has been an invalid question
- The next question has not been called
    - A challenge must be made at the time of the quizmaster's decision and before the next question is called. If a time-out is called immediately after a ruling, and a quizzer stands to challenge, the challenge may be done prior to the time-out.
- No conferring has occurred between the quizzer challenging and anyone else. Conferring with anyone else prior to a challenge will result in:
    - The challenge being disallowed
    - A foul being awarded to the quizzer.

Once a team has requested an explanation of a ruling, and that explanation has been given, all teams lose the right to challenge.

- If an explanation of a ruling is requested, the quizmaster will ask if any team wants to challenge.

The result of a challenge may not be challenged.

If the challenge is accepted:

- Points or error points that reflect the new ruling of the judge will be recorded.
- A new question of the same number will be given if the question is ruled illegal.

When a challenge is made, the quizmaster must give each team's captain or co-captain an opportunity to speak to the challenge before making a ruling on the challenge. Whichever team is being challenged against will have the right to speak last.

## Protests

Coaches, including assistant coaches, of the teams participating in a quiz, may place the quiz under protest under the following conditions:

- When a coach feels a logistical rule has been broken by the quiz officials.
- When a coach feels a judgment call has been made incorrectly, the call must be challenged by a captain/co-captain before the coach may protest.
- The protest must be placed before the next question is called.
    - This means the protest must apply to the question and ruling that just happened.
- The coach may only confer with their assistant coach and substitute quizzer, before protesting.
- The quiz officials and coaches will meet privately and attempt to come to an agreement. If no agreement is reached within 10 minutes, the meet director will arbitrate and determine the just solution.
- If a protest is launched after question number 20 is completed it must be done immediately after the ruling is announced.

### Example

Logistical Rule: when the quizmaster did not allow the full 30 seconds for the quizzer to answer when the quizzer was in context and had not given any wrong information.

## Fouls

- Fouls may be called by any quiz official: the quizmaster, answer judge, or scorekeeper.
- A foul must be called before the quizmaster calls for the next question.
- If the officials fail to call a foul, a coach or captain may call it to the attention of the quizmaster. If in the quizmaster's (and/or the other officials') opinion a foul might have been committed, the quizmaster will give due warning to the violating team. A foul cannot be charged, and points cannot be deducted when the quizmaster receives such help from a coach or captain.
- The quizzer upon whom a foul is called becomes ineligible to jump on that question number, including any alphanumeric question numbers.
    - The chair remains ineligible to jump on that question number, including any alphanumeric question numbers, even if the quizzer who committed the foul is substituted for.
- Three fouls by a quizzer eliminate that quizzer from the quiz. The quizzer must leave the platform immediately. His/her seat will continue to be ineligible to jump for the entire question number, including any alphanumeric question numbers.

The following are fouls:

- Team members (quizzers, coaches) communicating with each other, other teams, or with the audience between the time the question type is introduced, and points are awarded.
     - Communication can include non-verbal communication.
- The use of the hands to assist in jumping. Hands may not touch any part of the chair or the floor from the time "Question" is called until the quizmaster recognizes the first one up.
- When electronic equipment is used, if any light goes on after the quizmaster calls "Question" and before they begin to discernibly read the question.
    - Discernibly includes the quizmaster's mouth forming a word shape.
- During a Reference question or Quote question, when electronic equipment is used, if any light goes on after the quizmaster calls "Question" and before they begin to discernibly read the chapter number.
- Starting to answer before being recognized by the Quizmaster.
- Having more than the designated team members, one coach, and an assistant coach on the quiz platform during a time-out.
- Challenging after conferring with anyone
- If a captain or co-captain confers with his/her coach or other quizzers prior to issuing a challenge. In addition, the challenge will not be allowed.
- Infraction of the rules, in spirit as well as in the letter, as discerned by the quiz officials.

**Individual Fouls**

### How to Score Individual and Team Points

#### Individual Points

All points that occur during a bonus question or during overtime do not contribute to the individual score of a quizzer.

#### Points Earned

- +20 Points for every correct question & toss-up question
- +10 Points for every quiz out without error

#### Points Deducted

- -10 Points for 2nd and subsequent personal errors
- -10 Points for 3rd personal foul

#### Team Points

All points earned or deducted by an individual are to be counted towards the team's points.

#### Points Earned

- +20 Points for each team present at the scheduled start time of the quiz.
     - Teams that arrive late due to quizzing in another room are excused from the forfeiture of these points. If a single quizzer is late, the coach can decide to keep the +20 points by keeping the late quizzer out the whole quiz, or forfeit the points by subbing the quizzer in after question number 1. This decision must occur before the quiz has been started.
- +10 Points for the 1st correct answer given by the 3rd and subsequent quizzer on the team.
- +20 Points for every correct bonus question before question number 17
     - In 2 Team Quizzes, this scoring rule does not apply
- +10 Points for every correct bonus question after and including question number 17
     - In 2 Team Quizzes, all correct bonus questions are worth 10 points

#### Points Deducted

Team errors are the sum of all individual, non-bonus errors

- -10 Points for every team error starting at team error number 3
- -10 Points for every error on a question or toss-up question starting at question number 17
- -10 Points for 4th and subsequent team fouls
- -10 Points for 2nd and subsequent overruled challenges & protests
- -10 Points at the determination of the room officials that a deliberate attempt was made to forfeit a question.
- No more than -10 points can be deducted per question asked due to an error.
     - Non-error related deducted points are cumulative.

### Scoring Logic

This is the scoring logic, defined using English-Script. (For more information, see <https://metacpan.org/pod/English::Script#DEFAULT-GRAMMAR>).

    If the quiz event is a "question", then apply the following block.
        If the ruling is "correct", then apply the following block.
            If the current question form is not "Bonus", then apply the following block.

            For each specific quizzer in the team roster, apply the following block.
                If the specific quizzer correct answers value is greater than 0,
                    then add 1 to the team quizzers with correct answers.
