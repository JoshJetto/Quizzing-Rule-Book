# Quiz Meets

The tournament brackets are based on three things: A preliminary round, an elimination round (at the discretion of the meet director), and championship quizzes.

## Preliminary Rounds

- Team Points are calculated using a team's score at the end of question 20, together with their place, which could be determined at the end of question 20, or after the end of overtime.
    - Teams start with a base number of points based on their place, and receive additional points based on their team score. The specifics are detailed in the section below.
- In case of a tie, points are awarded according to the team score at the end of question 20.
    - Overtime is used solely to determine placements.
- If ties are not being broken in prelims, more than one team can receive First place, Second place, or Third place points.

### Team Points Calculation

    Set place to 1.
    For each team in the teams list, apply the following block.
        If place is 1, then apply the following block.
            Set base points to 10.
            Set overage origin to 100.
        This is the end of the block.
        Otherwise, if place is 2, then apply the following block.
            Set base points to 5.
            Set overage origin to 60.
        This is the end of the block.
        Otherwise, if place is 3, then apply the following block.
            Set base points to 1.
            Set overage origin to 30.
        This is the end of the block.

        Set score overage to team score at the end of regular quizzing minus overage origin.
        If score overage is less than 0, then set score overage to 0.
        Set team points to score overage divided by 10 plus base points.
    This is the end of the block.

## Elimination Rounds

When more than nine teams are involved, at the determination of the meet director and announced before the meet begins, there may be XYZ quizzes, following these guidelines:

- If there are 10 to 14 teams, the top 9 should be placed into a final nine championship bracket after the opening round, for the elimination round, and the remaining teams dropped.
- If there are 15 to 20 teams, the top 6 teams should be placed in the championship bracket, the next 9 places (7 through 15) should quiz in the intermediate quizzes given below (XYZ) and the remaining teams should be dropped.
- If there are more than 24 teams, the top 6 should be placed in the championship bracket, teams 7-15 should quiz in the XYZ quizzes to determine places 7-15. Teams 16-24 will quiz in XXYYZZ intermediate quizzes given below to determine their placement.

A Consolation final 9 bracket will be used for positions 10-15 (determined by XYZ quizzes) and places 16-18 determined by XXYYZZ quizzes. The teams in the XYZ quizzes cannot move below position 15, regardless of how low their XYZ quiz score was. Likewise, the teams in the XXYYZZ quizzes cannot move above position 16, regardless of how high their intermediate quiz scores were.

### XYZ Quizzes

- Quiz X: Teams 7, 12, 15
- Quiz Y: Teams 8, 11, 14
- Quiz Z: Teams 9, 10, 13

### XXYYZZ Quizzes

- Quiz XX: Teams 16, 21, 24
- Quiz YY: Teams 17, 20, 23
- Quiz ZZ: Teams 18, 19, 22

There will be a tie-breaker quiz for positions 6, 15, and 24. Ties for positions 7 through 14 will be broken in accordance with the following priorities:

- Head-to-head competition in previous quizzes.
- Total points scored in preliminaries.
- Least number of errors.

Points earned in these quizzes should be added to the points earned in the opening round by each team. The highest three teams, based on the point system above, are then placed in the above bracket. The next six teams are placed in the lower bracket.

### Elimination Round Brackets:

#### Tournament Bracket "A"

This bracket is based on the "winner-move-up" philosophy and is designed to select the best team out of a possible nine teams through winning rather than losing. The teams are then arranged in order (from first to ninth place) by points. The winners of quizzes A, D, and F meet in quiz G for the championship.

In this bracket the top three teams are involved in a triple elimination, the middle three teams in a double elimination and the last three teams in a single elimination. This way only those teams that have earned the right through winning will advance to the final quiz.

## Championship Quizzes

A team must win twice to become the champion team. All three teams will continue to quiz until one team wins twice.

- If the same team wins the first two championship quizzes,
    - Second place is determined by the most second places. If that is a tie, second place will be determined by Clarification (below).
- If the Champion team is determined in 3 quizzes
    - Second and third places will be determined by Clarification (below).
- If the Champion team is determined in 4 quizzes
    - Second place is determined by the most second places. If that is a tie, second place will be determined by Clarification (below).

### Clarification for second and third place:

Second place will be determined as follows:

- The team that scored the most points in the Championship Quizzes; or if there is a tie,
    - The winner if the two teams quizzed earlier; or
    - The team with the highest average points in the final nine; or if there is a tie,
    - The highest standing in the preliminary round.
