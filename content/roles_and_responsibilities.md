# Roles and Responsibilities

## Team Organization
Teams can have up to 5 quizzers on it. Teams can have up to 4 quizzers in the quiz at any given time.

### Quizzers

### Captains
- Scorekeepers must be notified which quizzer is captain and co-captain before the quizzers take their seats to begin the quiz.
- The team captain and co-captain may change during a given competition but not during a quiz.
- Only the team captain or co-captain may challenge a decision or respond to a challenge.  If both the captain and co-captain have errored out, another quizzer can be designated by the coach to respond to or initiate challenges.   

### Coaches

## Quiz Officials
- No comment other than “correct” or “incorrect” need be announced by the quiz officials in making a decision.  
    - However, at the discretion of the answer judge and quizmaster or at the request of the captain, additional information may be given:
        - If the additional information regarding the ruling is provided at the discretion of the AJ/QM, and not at the request of the captain, this is not considered an explanation of a ruling (which would invalidate a Challenge or Protest).
        - If the captain requests additional information regarding the ruling, this is considered an explanation of a ruling, and invalidates a Challenge or Protest. Before replying to a request for explanation, the QM must ask all teams if they wish to Challenge.

### Quizmasters
The Quizmaster should: 
- Be thoroughly acquainted with all rules, procedures, and material of that quiz year.
- Be impartial and render decisions consistently.
- See that all officials are briefed regarding rules and procedures.
- Read at a normal conversation rate.  Hesitating or reading too quickly must be avoided since either may cause inaccurate quizzing.
    - Read all questions at the same rate of speed with the ability to stop reading the question at the exact moment a jump is made.
- Keep the quiz moving at a consistent pace.  A quiz should not be rushed, but it is important to maintain the quickest pace which does not interfere with accuracy.
- Be open to a challenge and be willing to evaluate whatever the captains or co- captains feel is in error.
- Facilitate a positive, uplifting environment throughout the quiz.  Quizmasters should speak clearly and be enthusiastic about quizzing. To this end, quizzers should be called by name, the score should be announced often (when a scoreboard is not present), and bonuses and quiz-outs should be promptly recognized.

The Quizmaster must:
- Rule immediately upon an obviously correct or incorrect answer if there is no indication from the answer judge to the contrary. 
    - When an answer is in question (different than what is on the card), the quizmaster will discuss with the answer judge.
- During the 30-second answering period use the following prompts:
    - If a quizzer has provided all the information in the answer, except the identification of a pronoun present which is part of the answer, the quizmaster will ask the quizzer to identify the specific pronoun, (example: “Can you identify ‘He’?” or “Can you identify ‘They’?”) The quizmaster is not allowed to say anything other than what the quizzer has already said when asking for the identification.   A pronoun may need to be identified only if the identification (antecedent) is in context.
    - On a Chapter-Verse Reference Question (CVR) or Chapter-Only Reference Question (CR), if the quizzer has given all the information in both the question and the answer and the complete question was not read, the quizmaster will ask, "What is your question?"
    - On a Finish-The-Verse (FTV), Quote, or Finish This (FT) type question, once the quizzer has quoted to the end of the required verse or verses, if the quote is not yet word-perfect, the quizmaster will say, "Again."  This will occur as often as needed until the quizzer quotes the verse perfectly or the 30-second time limit expires.  
        - The quizmaster is not allowed to say “again” until the quizzer has come to the end of the verse, each time through, as this would give the quizzer information about where their mistake was made.
    - Once all of the information in both the question and answer have been given, but something needs to be fixed (e.g. Unique word) the quizmaster will say “Again”.
    - On a Situation (SIT) type question, when the quizzer has completed the Quotation the quizmaster will say, “Quote is complete.”
    - On an INT or MA Question, if all of the information in the answer has been given, but the quizzer is missing information in the question, the quizmaster will say “More”.
    - On a Situation question, because the quotation is part of the question, the quizmaster will say “More” when required information from the quotation is missing.
    - On a Q, Q2, CVR, MACVR, CR, MACR question, if either the chapter or verse number were not completely finished when the quizzer jumped, the quizmaster will say “More”. 
        - Note: On a CVR/MACVR, CR/MACR Question once the quizzer has provided all the information in both the question and answer the quizmaster will say “What is your question”, if the response to the question supplied by the quizzer is “More”, the quizzer should consider whether the quizmaster had completely pronounced the chapter or verse number. 
    - On a Reference type question, if the quizzer gives a question that is different than the one on the card, the quizmaster and answer judge must ensure that the question given is the exact same type as the one on the card.
    - Consult with the answer judge(s) at any time he or she feels is necessary, provided it does not infringe upon the 30 seconds allotted the quizzer.
    - If an explanation of a ruling is requested by a captain, the quizmaster will ask if any team wants to challenge before the explanation is given.

### Answer Judges
- All conferring among quizmaster and answer judge(s) shall be done privately.
    - It is the answer judge who will determine the accuracy of its content and make a ruling accordingly.
- Will watch the quizmaster’s questions for accuracy of reading.
- Ensures the quizzer is recognized by the quizmaster when his/her light comes on.

### Scorekeepers
- The scorekeeper will tally and immediately announce when a quizzer has erred out, quizzed out, or fouled out.
- The scorekeeper will keep record of all time-outs.
- To determine eligibility for re-substitution, the scorekeeper will keep record of the number of questions a substitute quizzer has remained out. 
- Either read the score or have the score ready to be read at the beginning of time-outs, when there is no scoreboard.
- The scorekeeper shall have the score sheets signed by the coaches at the conclusion of each quiz, and report to the statistician.
