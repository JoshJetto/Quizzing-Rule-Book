## Scope

This policy provides a collaborative framework for the development and governance of Alliance Bible quizzing. It is intended to suggest a means by which quizzing and quizzing events can be promoted and coordinated. The policy assigns matters of program, policy and procedure to a leadership team. Responsibilities for logistical support remain with the LIFE Office for the Alliance.

## C&MA Quizzing Leadership Team (CQLT)

A C&MA leadership team will give oversight to quizzing and coordinate policies and procedures in both Canada and the U.S. as follows:

A maximum of two non-Alliance members can be voted onto the CQLT with a maximum of one per election. Nominations follow the same approval process as listed in the election section below.

The director of the LIFE Office shall serve ex officio as a resource to the leadership team to coordinate programming and appropriate support for the International Quizzing Competition. The national youth director of each country or an equivalent representative may participate in any meeting of the CQLT.

Members serve for a three-year term with the possibility of 2 consecutive terms. Members serving consecutive terms will experience a gap of at least one year before being eligible for re-election. The LIFE office director and national youth directors, who serve ex officio as a non-voting member are exempt from a gap year.

### Election

An election for team members shall be held annually. Normally two new members will be elected each year.

Each district may nominate a person for the CQLT and the CQLT will create a short list of 2 names per vacancy for elections unless fewer names are nominated. Nominees must have the approval of the District quizzing point person, the District Superintendent or his appointee and the nomineeaEURtms pastor. Ballots will be sent to every district quiz program. Each participating district shall be entitled to one vote for each vacancy. If a representative is needed from one country, then the person from that country with the highest vote will be elected followed by the person with the highest number of votes.

### Meetings

Normally the CQLT will meet three times annually, with at least one face to face meeting.

### Chair

The CQLT will annually elect a member to serve as chair.

Any amendment to the Alliance Bible Quizzing rule book must be approved by a majority of the members of the CQLT.

If the international quiz meet is held in a "low cost" location, registration fees may generate a modest surplus which is to be used to offset "high cost" venues in future years.

- Additional funds are necessary for the CQLT to fulfill its proposed responsibilities. In addition to C&MA start up grants, additional annual sources of income must be identified. Any yearly surplus in CQLT funds will be carried forward to use for quizzing development in future years.

- The CQLT will be responsible for developing and managing a balanced annual budget and for distributing annual financial reports to the quizzing districts.
