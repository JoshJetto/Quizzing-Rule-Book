## C&MA Quizzing Leadership Team (CQLT)

A C&MA leadership team will give oversight to quizzing and coordinate policies and procedures in both Canada and the U.S. as follows:

### Responsibilities

The CQLT will promote, coordinate, and provide general oversight for Alliance Bible Quizzing including but not limited to:

- Finding ways that quizzing can support and integrate into local church, district and national ministries
- Promoting and growing quizzing in districts in Canada and the U.S.
- Developing and maintaining uniform policies, including choice of translation
- Facilitating the provision of resources to strengthen quizzing (including coordinating question writing, editing, distributing the same)
- Developing and managing an annual program budget
- Planning and giving oversight to the International Quizzing Competition
- Facilitating communications among quizzing leadership.
- Maintaining records and databases as necessary
- To establish task groups as necessary

### Composition

The CQLT shall consist of six persons; with no more than one representative from any one district, if possible, chosen from among the district team leaders and/or adult coaches of district quizzing teams. At least two members of the CQLT shall be chosen from Canadian team coaches and at least two members shall be chosen from among U.S. team coaches to ensure the interests of Alliance churches and districts in each country are represented. The director of Life Impact Ministries shall serve ex officio as a resource to the leadership team to coordinate programming and appropriate support for the International Quizzing Competition. The national youth director of each country or an equivalent representative may participate in any meeting of the CQLT.

### Term

Members will serve for a three year term, with a gap of at least one year before being eligible for re-election with the exception of the director for LIM who serves ex officio as a non-voting member.

### Election

An election for team members shall be held annually. Normally two new members will be elected each year.

Each district may nominate a person for the CQLT and CQLT will create a short list of at least 2 names per vacancy for elections. Nominees must attend an Alliance church and must have the approval of the District quizzing point person, the District Superintendent or his appointee and the nominee's pastor. Ballots will be sent to every district quiz program. Each participating district shall be entitled to one vote for each vacancy. If a representative is needed from one country, then the person from that country with the highest vote will be elected followed by the person with the highest amount of votes.

### Meetings

Normally the CQLT will meet three times annually, with at least one face to face meeting.

### Chair

The CQLT will elect one of its members to serve as chair for the next year.

### Other

Additional information about the CQLT, its scope, and its relationship to the LIFE Office can be found on the C&MA Bible Quizzing Website.

Any amendment to the Alliance Bible Quizzing rule book must be approved by a majority of the members of the CQLT.
