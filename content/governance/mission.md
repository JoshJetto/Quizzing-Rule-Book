Mission Statement of Bible Quizzing:

> The mission of quizzing is to see visible evidence of the application of God's Word in the lifestyle of each participant.

Bible Quizzing is a ministry of the C&MA to assist teens to connect with God in a deeper way by Experiencing Him and Expanding His Kingdom.

It accomplishes this by:

- Providing teens with an opportunity to be involved with systematic study, application and memorization of God's Word.
- Building character, instilling self-discipline and encouraging prayer and unity.
- Equipping teens with the capacity to serve in other areas of ministry.
