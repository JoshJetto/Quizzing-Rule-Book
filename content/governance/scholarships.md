- A quizzer may earn a new scholarship at each year's finals, thereby accumulating scholarships.
- All college-financed scholarships will be equally divided between fall and spring semesters.
- All quizzers who have received scholarships must begin using their scholarships within 2 years of graduating from high school.

Awards and scholarship amounts will be announced annually. In addition to these scholarships, Alliance colleges may also offer additional scholarships to international, district, and local participants. Please contact the individual colleges for details.
