    - The first five words must be unique to all Quotations.
    - The quizzer is not required to repeat the quotation word-perfect but must be substantially close without leaving out key components of the quotation.
    - Must start at the beginning of a quotation or the beginning of a sentence within the quotation.  When a Situation question comes from a quotation that runs for more than 2 verses, the beginning of the Situation question must start within the first 2 verses of the quotation.
    - If the Quotation is split-up by non-quotation words, the Quotation will be read without the non-quotation words.
        - A situation question can combine two separate quotations as long as no words are added and the two quotes flow easily from one to another.  For example, Matthew 4:19 says, “Come, follow me”, Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.”  This example could be written, Who said it?  “Come, follow me, and I will send you out to fish for people” Answer:  Jesus.
- Questions regarding the Situation of the Quotation
    - Ask for who said it, to whom, how, why, when, where, or about whom. No other interrogatives are permissible.
