## Question Writing

### Preparation of Questions
- All questions must contain verbatim material. 
    - The only exception to this is Situation question Quotations, which could potentially involve a single Quotation, broken up by non-quotation words. This would result in the Situation Quotation being written without the non-quotation words in the middle of the two quotations.
- On some types, the addition of a single, approved, interrogative word at the very beginning or very end is required.

### Question Types

#### Interrogative (INT)
Must have exactly one inserted interrogative word at the very beginning of the question or at the very end of the question.
Must have a single answer.
Must include a unique word, or 2-3 word unique phrase within the first 5 words of the question. 

#### Multiple Answer (MA)
Must meet all the requirements of an INT, except the single answer requirement.
Must have more than one answer.
- The clarification of a single answer does not meet the above requirement.
- The identification of a singular pronoun does not meet the above requirement.
- The identification of a plural pronoun does meet the above requirement.
If one of the listed answers to a the multiple answers questions is a "negative" answer, this is deemed invalid as a Multiple Answer question.

#### Reference
Used to distinguish exact same words or phrases from the material.
The entire reference question is part of the required question + answer.
If a quizzer needs to provide the reference question, the provided reference question must: 
- Be of the exact same type as the one on the card (CR, CVR, MACR, MACVR).  The quizmaster and/or answer judge must check to confirm this.
- Have content AND wording is similar to the content and wording of the written question.
- Have the determining word or phrase of the written question. 
- The interrogative word used is not a factor when deciding the valid type of a reference question. 

##### Example
- Similar content and wording: CVR According to Luke chapter 23: 37 King of what?  A. The Jews The quizzer can give the question “King of what?” or “King of whom?”, as Jews could be referring to either nation (what) or people (whom).  In this case the quizzer could also give “King of the what?”
- Referencing the determining word or phrase, in the 50/50 example, “What men?”, and “Lawless what?, the questions are not similar.
- Further explanation on the interrogative word used in a reference question. 
    - If two identical phrases exist in the same chapter, but one occurrence grammatically calls for use of the "who" inserted interrogative word, and the other occurrence grammatically calls for the use of the "what" inserted interrogative word, that difference in grammatically dictated interrogative word does not change the fact that phrase from the material (that excludes the inserted interrogative word) occurs more than twice in the same chapter, necessitating a CVR question.
    - The above example does not mean that if the quizzer needs to provide a reference question that is a CVR, and their choice of interrogative word changes the question type to MACVR, that the quizzer has given a valid CVR. In this case, the validity changes based on the interrogative word, because of how the required answer changes.

##### Chapter-Verse (CVR)
Must have a single answer.
The question must contain a word or phrase that exists in more than one verse in the same chapter.
Context is the single verse.

##### Multiple-Answer, Chapter-Verse (MACVR)
Must meet all the requirements of a CVR except the single answer requirement.
Must also meet all the requirements of a MA except the unique word/phrase requirement.

##### Chapter (only) (CR)
The question must contain a word or phrase that exists more than once in the material and only once in the chapter.

##### Multiple-Answer, Chapter (only) (MACR)
Must meet all the requirements of a CR except the single answer requirement.
Must also meet all the requirements of a MA except the unique word/phrase requirement.

#### Quote/Finish
Must be quoted word-perfect.

##### Quote (QT)
A single verse
The entire reference is part of the required question + answer.
Quizzers may go back and correct their answers if done in the 30-second time limit.  The quizzer will be required to make one full correct rotation. However, the quizzer can be called correct if they have made a mistake only in one area of the verse AND correct the mistake making it abundantly clear to the quiz master and answer judge that they know where their mistake was, and what the corrected words are.
Context is defined as the verse or verses that are required.
The quizzer may not continue any non-required verse or verses.

##### Quote-these-Two-Verses (Q2V)
Two consecutive verses

##### Finish
The first five words must be unique to all Finish questions of the exact same type (e.g. FTV compared to all FTVs, FT to all FTs, F2V to all F2Vs, FTN to all FTNs).
The quizmaster will read the first five words of the question (less if a quizzer jumps)

The quizzer may not continue any non-required verse or verses.

##### Finish-the-Verse (FTV)
Begins at the beginning of a single verse and finishes at the end of that verse.

##### Finish-This (FT)
Begins in the middle of a verse and finishes at the end of the verse.  A FT must start at the beginning of a sentence or the beginning of a quotation.

##### Finish-these-Two-Verses (F2V)
Begins at the beginning of a verse and continues to the end of the next verse. Used when a verse is not strong enough on its own and needs another verse to explain it or can be used when two verses combined form an even stronger thought. 

##### Finish-This-and-the-Next (FTN)
Begins in the middle of a verse and finishes at the end of the next verse.  A FTN must start at the beginning of a sentence or the beginning of a quotation. Used when part of a verse is not strong enough on its own and needs another verse (or part of a verse) to explain it or can be used when two verses combined form an even stronger thought.

#### Situation (SIT)
Used only in the year where the Material Type is Narrative
Contains two parts to the question:
- Quotation
    - Must be a direct quotation from the material by a person or an entity. 
    - The quotation must not exceed two consecutive verses. 
    - The first five words must be unique to all Quotations.
    - The quizzer is not required to repeat the quotation word-perfect but must be substantially close without leaving out key components of the quotation.
    - Must start at the beginning of a quotation or the beginning of a sentence within the quotation.  When a Situation question comes from a quotation that runs for more than 2 verses, the beginning of the Situation question must start within the first 2 verses of the quotation.
    - If the Quotation is split-up by non-quotation words, the Quotation will be read without the non-quotation words.
        - A situation question can combine two separate quotations as long as no words are added and the two quotes flow easily from one to another. The quotation must be written excluding any non-quotation words in the middle of the quotations.
- Questions regarding the Situation of the Quotation
    - Ask for who said it, to whom, how, why, when, where, or about whom. No other interrogatives are permissible.
    - Can only ask for a maximum of 3 Questions
The answer to the Situation Question must be in context.

##### Example
Split quotation: For example, Matthew 4:19 says, “Come, follow me”, Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.”  This example could be written, Who said it?  “Come, follow me, and I will send you out to fish for people” Answer:  Jesus.

### Question Structure
This defines how a Quizmaster must introduce and read each question type.

4 parts: (1) Introduction part 1, (2) Introduction part 2, (3) Final Statement, (4) Actual Question
(1) "Question Number [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc ] is a [ TYPE ] question." 
(2) For Situation questions only: "I need to know [ who said it, how was it said, where was it said, etc ]"
(3) "Question Number [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc ] question"
(4) 
- For INT and MA, begin reading the question
- For Chapter Reference (and MACR), "According to [ Book Name ], Chapter [Chapter Number], ...."
- For Chapter Verse Reference (and MACVR, "According to [ Book Name ], Chapter [Chapter Number], Verse [ Verse Number], ......"
- For Quote Questions, "Quote [ Book Name ], Chapter [Chapter Number], Verse [ Verse Number]"
- For Quote these Two Verses Questions. "Quote [ Book Name ], Chapter [Chapter Number], Verses [ Verse Number 1] and [Verse Number 2]"
- For all Finish Questions (and sub-types), begin reading the verse(s)
- For Situation Questions, begin reading at the Quotation.

### Invalid Questions
Invalid Questions – Questions must be declared invalid by the quizmaster or answer judge(s) if:
- The answer requires interpretation by the quizzer.
- The question is ambiguous, tricky, or misleading.
- The question is multiple-choice.
- If the question is not answered.

When a question is deemed invalid and thrown out, it must be replaced with the exact same type of question.  (i.e. Interrogative replaced with Interrogative, MACVR replaced with MACVR, etc.)

#### Example
Regarding "if the question is not answered": If the question asks, “What is good” and the answer states what is not good, the question is not answered and is tricky or misleading.
